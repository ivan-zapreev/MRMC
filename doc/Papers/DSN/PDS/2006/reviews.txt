This paper presents an algorithm for detecting steady state on-the-fly during
transient analysis. The algorithm is supposed to be more efficient than
existing algorithms because it is based on a refinement of the Fox-Glynn
algorithm for computing Poisson probabilities. The refinement considers the
case when the function "f" in the Fox-Glynn algorithm does not change sign. The
presented algorithm has immediate application in probabilistic model checkers
for solving time-bounded reachability problems that can be expressed as
continuous-time Markov chains. 

The strongest reason that DSN should accept this paper is that it raises the
important issue of detecting steady state efficiently on-the-fly during
transient analysis of Markov chains. The paper also presents well how
on-the-fly steady-state detection is used in probabilistic model checking.

The strongest reasons that DSN should reject this paper are the
following:

- The limiting state probability vector in Table 1 is not correct. I think it
should be (0.0, 0.0, 1.0). Perhaps this is a typographical error? 

- The main proposition in the paper is flawed. In particular, the refinement of
the Fox-Glynn bounds (in Proposition 5), on which the steady-state on-the-fly
detection algorithm is based, is not correct. The refinement is based on
equation (25) in the paper. The first inequality in this equation cannot be
established since  0 <= f(i) <= ||f|| (for this case in which f is
non-negative). Since other theorems and corollaries are based on this
proposition, they are probably not correct also. 

- In addition to the data showing that the algorithm can detect steady state
safely, the authors should also present data showing that the algorithm is more
efficient (e.g. has better runtime) than existing algorithms. Figure 4 only
shows the comparison between having steady-state detection on and off for the
authors' tool MRMC. There is no data showing that the algorithm is more
efficient than other algorithms, which is one of the claims in the paper.

The paper can be improved by considering the following additional
suggestions: 

- Page 2, 2nd paragraph: "from the state of interest" might be confused as
referring to the goal state. Perhaps "from a given state" is better.

- Page 3, last parag: j in p*(0)_j should probably be i for consistency.

- Page 9, equation between equations (24) and (25): indexing using i for two
summations can be ambiguous.

- Page 11, last parag: It is not clear what the contention of the authors is
with regards to where the index i starts (0 or L_epsilon). It seems that the
indexing should be as in equation (28) so that the unaccounted for
probabilities can be computed.

- Page 19, last parag: I think the starting state is 1 instead of 0.

- Many words throughout the paper are broken up, for example, "fi nish" on page
1, first parag.

- The paper does not meet the formatting requirements. It seems to have 23
pages, single spaced, and smaller font.

This paper presents a method to obtain solution efficiency and
accuracy for time-bounded reachability problems with CTMCs.
More specifically, it develops a solution for the probability to
reach a goal state or a set of goal states within a given time bound,
such that prior to reaching the goal certain states are avoided.
The study yields a procedure for steady-state detection for
time-bounded reachability problems during CTMC transient analysis,
called on-the-fly steady state detection.

Motivation is clearly illustrated and mathematical basics are
introduced in Section 2.  The derivation sections look sophisticated
and solid.  (But I am not a model solution person and am a modeling
application person.)

The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the approach.
That section is fairly interesting.  However it looks thin when
compared with those other sections on mathematical derivation.
It is not explained why those two problems have to be treated as
time-bounded reachability problems, instead of directly using
standard methods for transient CTMC analysis.  Also it's a kind of
disappointing that neither the "slowly convergent CTMC" example nor
the workstation cluster problem addresses the problem type that is
highlighted in the introductory section, i.e., the applications in
which certain states must be avoided before reaching the goal state(s).

A possible typo: should the starting state 0 be the left most state
that has a low outgoing rate and a high incoming rate?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The paper presents in detail an algorithm for detecting steady-state
on-the-fly, when performing transient analysis of continuous-time Markov chain.
The detection algorithm is based on a well-known result published by Fox-Glyn.
They explore the structure of the model to safely detect equilibrium.

The paper seems to be well-written and all details of the algorithm are given,
which makes it very hard to follow; 

The question is: is the paper well adapted for an oral presentation in a
conference like PDS?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This paper contains some publishable material, but it is very poorly explained
and motivated. The title, some of the notation, and much of the text, is more
confusing than enlightening. The authors keep talking about 'steady-state
detection', but the problem considered is basically one of computing the
distribution of certain first passage times of a Markov process from some
states to some other states. This computational problem has nothing to do with
steady-state detection (which is the statistical problem of deciding whether an
observed process can be said to have reached steady-state or not). The fact
that an embedded discrete time Markov chain is used in the computation, and the
latter's steady-state probabilities are used in order to formulate a
termination criterion, is incidental. What is being computed is still a
transient quantity; the question is when to stop the iterations in order to
obtain an accurate result. None of that is really made clear.

Specific comments.
1. There is no need to present known and already published material (most of
sections 2 and 3).
2. The notation $\gamma(i)$ (eqn (9) and later) should be replaced by 
$\gamma_i(t)$. Similarly for $w(i)$.
3. There is no need for the 0 in $\pi(0,t)$, $\pi^*(0,t)$, $p(0,i)$ and 
$p^*(0)$.
4. The examples are not very illuminating: the graphs are almost unreadable; a
plot labeled 'MatLab' appears to be missing; how can the steady-state vector
$p^*$ in table 1 be equal to (1,1,1)? (What is the embedded Markov chain in
this case?)
5. Figure 4, which is presented in order to summarize the achievements of the
paper, is quite meaningless. In it, time is allowed to grow to very large
values. But we know, trivially, that in the long run any target state is
reached with probability 1, so what exactly is being computed here and why?
